# Entity Recognition Project.

This is not a project done during the Master, it is a research project project done the year before at EURECOM.

Entity Recognition is the task of assigning real word entities to textual mentions. 

I present two notebooks :
* One is on using the TF-IDF document matrix to extracts brands names in a unsupervised way.
* The other is an attempt at building a siamese recurrent neural net to compare entities.
