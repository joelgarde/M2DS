# Report for M2 DS: System for Big Data. 

I did most of the literature survey, and wrote most the report
on the Hashing algorithms (part 1.2, 2.2, 3.2), (with the exception of the spark part).

You can find the corresponding code here:
https://github.com/ulyssedemay/group-by/tree/main/Hash/final/src/main/java/raw_java

I wrote 99% of the code in this folder. (Hashing algorithms, single thread and multi-thread).

This is maybe the most extensive actual coding example I have.
